The official repository for [Project City Build](https://projectcitybuild.com)'s homepage and related web services.

### Stack
* Frameworks: Laravel 8, ReactJS 16
* Environment: Dockerised with Laravel Sail
* CI/CD: Github Actions, Codecov

All branches, commits and pull-requests are continuously tested

### Requirements
* Docker

We use Laravel Sail to create a dockerised development environment. You can also run it as a traditional application, you'll need:

* PHP 7.4
* MySQL/MariaDB
* Composer
* NPM

### Can I contribute?
Absolutely. Feel free to fork and send pull requests any time. We'd be thrilled to have some help.

# Contributing

You should read the [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail) documentation first. If you're using Windows you have to run it through WSL2.

## First time setup

1. Run `cp .env.example .env`, then edit the file as appropriate (see below)
2. Run `make bootstrap`
3. Run `alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'` to add the `sail` alias

You'll then be able to access the website on `http://localhost`

## Development
Once *First time setup* is complete, you only need to run one command to boot up the environment:

`sail up -d` to start Sail

For front-end development, you'll want to run:

`sail npm watch` to start NPM build. This also starts BrowserSync on `http://localhost:3000`

You can enter the container at any time with `sail shell`

### Linter

We automatically run [PHP Insights](https://phpinsights.com/) on CI for linting.

You can run the linter locally with `sail php artisan insights`

If you want automatic fixing, you can run it with the `--fix` option

### Database
* If the database schema has changed, remember to run `sail artisan migrate` from inside the workspace container to ensure you always have the latest schema.

### S3 Bucket
Backups go to an S3 bucket specified in the `backup` disk. To run this functionality in development, you need to configure a valid bucket. To avoid having to use a real one:

1. Go to `http://localhost:9000`, using the credentials minioadmin/minioadmin
2. Make a bucket called `pcb-backup`
3. Put this in your `.env`:

```dotenv
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=pcb-backup
AWS_ENDPOINT="http://minio:9000"
AWS_URL="http://minio:9000"
```

### Stripe Webhooks
Use [stripe-cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to receive payment webhooks locally.

After installing, run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost/api/webhooks/stripe` to forward webhook events to the correct endpoint. Copy the code you're given into the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env value.

## Testing
* Run `sail test` to run all unit/integration tests
* Enter the container with `sail shell` and run `phpstan -c phpstan.neon` to run PHP analysis
